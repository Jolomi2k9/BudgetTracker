The user interface of the application is simple , on the home screen we will have the list of scanned receipt if available  and an add button in full view, it means the user has access to the tools they need as soon as they launch the app. This design is also in keeping with similar applications in the space.
The ability to export the scanned receipt to other applications and offload the complicated task of accounting means this application can focus on the most tedious aspect of bookkeeping, data entry ,and make it has seamless as possible.
